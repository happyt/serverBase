## testing node and express

A project to sum up some simple server based around node.js, express
with pure.css themes and an API that can access a mongoDB database. This will
be my current teaching base. 

There may be versions other than master - for learning stages
A - basic express server, web page, css, mongoDB, insert entry, list entries
B - separate config file, json data file, fonts, icons
C - web socket chat
D - firebase ?
E - react version
F - angular 2 ?

A - centre page, responsive
    theme working
    button themed

B - update, upsert into array

Added font-awesome - need to choose a font
Could add an icon script

Plan to add a react version of the pages, to compare and learn

And then maybe an angular2 version
