## testing node and express

A project to sum up some simple server based around node.js, express
with pure.css themes and an API that can access a mongoDB database. This Will
be my current teaching base. 

Added font-awesome - need to choose a font
Could add an icon script

Plan to add a react version of the pages, to compare and learn

And then maybe an angular2 version
